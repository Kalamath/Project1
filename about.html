            <p class="col-8 description">Influencer culture has helped to promote brands as well as larger social issues
                and charities that celebrities are passionate about. Historically, donations from individuals account
                for over two-thirds of all donations. If you add in gifts from
                bequests, then the category accounts for nearly 80% of all giving. In other words, the donating public,
                not big foundations or corporations, is responsible for the vast majority of annual donations.

                <br></br>

                The masses have a hard time knowing what a good first step to social activism or
                giving back is and bWoke is aiming to create measurable change by giving people an easy tool to find
                causes close to their hearts and close to their homes. 
                
                We want to use people's natural admiration for
                celebrities to connect the public to celebrity endorsed charities to bridge the gap between  personal passion and pop
                culture; we aim to connect everyday folks to those their passions in hopes of creating larger social change
                through already established followings.
